<h2>c++</h2>
The C ++ Plus language is one of the high performance and advanced programming languages. It was developed on the C language with the addition of rows, mathematical operators, codes, programs and other additions that make it a very strong and diversified language and uses in many areas the C ++ programming language of object-oriented programming languages.
<h2>C ++ uses</h2>
<p>C ++ uses many different fields of technology, including:</p>
<p>1-The C ++ Plus programming language is used to build operating systems, including building different software systems and user programs.</p>
<p>2-It is used in creating and developing various video games due to its high effectiveness in this.</p>
<p>3-It is used in creating and developing various video games due to its high effectiveness in this.</p>
<p>4-Some parts of Android and search engines for Google also need to be written in C ++ in extension to many other uses of the C ++ programming language due to the distinctiveness of the C ++ language.</p>
<h2>advantages of c++</h2>
<p>The C ++  programming language is characterized by combining the characteristics of high-level languages ​​as well as low-level languages. The C ++ programming language is close to the high-level C language, and also close to the assembly language, which is a low level.</p>
<p>1-C ++  is characterized by multi-objectivity, has been developed cooperaion with action programs to build the program in a way that depends on the objects by the C ++ Plus where each object has its own tools that can be worked on.</p>
<p>2-C ++ can be considered one of the top languages ​​for designers as it is used in designing games and can be used in designing interfaces and others.</p>
<p>3-C ++ is a powerful language that is quick and high execution, which makes it used to create complex programs for developing desktop applications and web browsers.</p>
<p>4-C ++ translations are also available to programmers on several types of devices.</p>
<p>5-C++ is a flexible language so you can write mathematical expressions using variables of real numbers and whole numbers completely easily.</p>
