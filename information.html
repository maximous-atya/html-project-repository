        <h3>programming language</h3>
        <p>Programming languages ​​are simply a set of commands and instructions for a computer to do a certain task. It is the point of contact between a person and a computer.</p>
        <p>The word programming languages ​​often refers to High-Level Languages, which are the languages ​​closest to the human language and consist of words understood by humans such as If, While, and others. Examples of these languages ​​are C ++, Python, FORTRAN and others. These languages ​​are high level and if they are closer to the human language, they are It is complicated with regard to languages ​​that the computer actually understands, which is machine language and is composed of zero or one.</p>
        <p>And unlike human languages ​​that can be understood even with some errors, programming languages ​​are not that elastic . Just a small mistake in the program is like forgetting; Or a slight mistake, the program will not run.</p>
        <h3>programming language uses</h3>
        <p>The uses of programming languages ​​are many and endless, perhaps the most famous are: web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, games and simulation programs, calculation programs and many others. As you know, we mean here high-level languages ​​languages.</p>
